*Jul 2014 â€“ Aug 2014*<br/>
*Mobile Development Intern*<br/>
*Tunis, Tunisia*<br/>
   

I was one of the 12 graduate interns selected out of hundreds of applicants to participate in Orange Summer Challenge 2014. We were devided into 3 teams and the goal to build the best mobile app (iOS and Android). Me and my teamates we chose the theme of photography and we performed a market research on the available apps corresponding to this theme. Selfies were booming at the time and big companies were developing mainly hardware/accessories solution like special cameras and selfie sticks to respond to this trend. We decided to launch an Instagram like social network but with tailored photography features for selfies. I Led the development of the all-in-one iOS version offering advanced features like Voice Recognition, Face Detection, and Photo Editing. Features that help taking beautiful selfies more conveniently and facilitate editing and sharing them. I used [Parse](https://parse.com) API for the back-end which is a Facebook PaaS similar to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). I contributed also to the app launching campaign by building its landing page, and helped in shooting its promotional video. I detailed the app design and features in the report (FR) linked below.<br/>
