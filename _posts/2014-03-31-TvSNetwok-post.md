Since I was huge fan of TV shows and I wanted to get familiar with NoSQL databases, I got the idea to leverage my skills in J2EE and [Spring MVC](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) Framework specifically to build a web application for TV shows' fans that writes and reads data from a column-oriented NoSQL database. I chose [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) since it's one of most used NoSQL databases thanks to its fault-tolerance, linear scalability and high availability. it outperforms in fact most of the popular NoSQL alternatives. I used EasyCassandra ORM to interface between Cassandra and Spring Controllers.
