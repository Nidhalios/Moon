During the summer of 2013, I had the chance to join Flag Engineering startup to design and build an m-commerce iOS app for a retail client company called Koinkoo. It's a company that sells motorcycle equipments in stores and online thanks to a Magento e-commerce website. The project objective was to provide the same services of the Magento website in a native iPhone app as another intuitive and convenient channel for buyers to discover and order products. After understanding the different functional and non-functional requirements, I designed the application mockup using Evolus Pencil software, and created the needed UI elements in Photoshop. As I had access only to the products JSON web service provided by the Magento CMS, I build the remaing JSON web services localy using PHP and MySQL. Using an iterative and incremental approach, I implemented and tested the main following functionalities: products catalogue, user account setting, cart management, and payment. The project report linked below provides further details on this project.<br/>
