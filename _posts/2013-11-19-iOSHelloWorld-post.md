The following video tutorial illustrates the creation of a simple iOS 7 iPhone application using the IDE xCode 5. During this demo, you'll be able to manipulate objective-c programming language and the storyboard which really simplifies the design and the transition between the different views. I hope you enjoy it, if you have any questions just leave a comment bellow and i'll answer you as soon as possible ! <br/>
